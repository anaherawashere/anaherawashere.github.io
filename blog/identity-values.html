      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

      <p>
        During the first COVID-19 lockdown, I was asked to jump on the phones to
        help with donation cancellation calls because the person who usually
        handled them was overwhelmed. I was given a script that had me ask
        people to downgrade their gift or pause it before finally agreeing to
        cancel their donation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I felt super uncomfortable asking these questions. Most people were
        calling because they had lost their jobs or weren't getting paid during
        the lockdown and had no extra money to give. It felt ethically wrong to
        ask them to continue donating in any form when they were struggling
        themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I knew I had to ask because people still had cancer, and our
        organisation’s services were needed more than ever. If I didn’t at least
        ask, we might lose a supporter who didn’t realise they had options other
        than cancelling outright.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, looking back, I think that experience was a great learning moment
        for me. It taught me to evaluate situations carefully and to push
        through uncomfortable feelings for the greater good. I realised that
        providing people with all their options helps them make informed
        decisions, which is crucial. This experience definitely helped make me a
        better fundraiser.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.

      <p>
        Te Ao Māori shapes the way I see the world. The biggest thing is
        understanding that everything is connected. I tend to look at things
        holistically and see how even the smallest details are part of something
        bigger. My relationship with people and the way I treat them is also
        deeply influenced by manaakitanga, which drives me to show respect,
        generosity, and care.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am very intentional about the people I have around me. I gravitate
        towards those who think and care deeply and are authentically
        themselves. I appreciate friends who enjoy having deep conversations but
        also respect quiet moments and love being silly, whether it's talking
        about TikToks or juicy gossip. I value kindness and am drawn to people
        who challenge me to see the world differently and inspire me to care
        more deeply about new things.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>

      <p>
        My strengths are my creativity, curiosity and connecting with people. My
        sense is that I fit being a programmer and the mindset of
        problem-solving - some of my favourite things to do at work is coming up
        with creative solutions. And the stuff about the role being more than
        concepts and more human skills suits me great. I'm really riding on the
        sparkling personality bit!
      </p>

      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the same vein of problem-solving, I think I tend to sit on problems
        longer than I should before I ask for help. I like how that has been
        mentioned a few times to stick to the timebox and ask for help so you
        can move on. I think having that culture from the get go and knowing
        that there are lots of others in the same boat is super helpful.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>

      <p>
        I had a situation where I wanted to introduce a planning tool like
        Monday.com to replace our project planner in Excel spreadsheets. I
        needed something more functional, but some of the team were resistant to
        learning a new tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        To address this, I worked through introducing and teaching people how to
        use it. I had team members explore the tool before we officially
        implemented it and gave them the opportunity to ask questions. It
        reminded me of flipped learning, where you introduce new concepts for
        people to explore on their own before diving into them fully. However,
        not everyone took the time to trial the tool on their own, which limited
        the effectiveness of this approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I were to try again, I would probably introduce the idea of a new
        tool when I first started researching my options. Surprising people with
        something new was a mistake. I think they would have been less resistant
        if they had felt part of the journey from the beginning.
      </p>

      <p>
        By involving the team early on and seeking their input during the
        research phase, they would likely feel more invested and open to the
        change. This approach could foster a sense of ownership and reduce
        resistance, making the transition smoother and more collaborative.
