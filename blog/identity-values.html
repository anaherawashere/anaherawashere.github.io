                Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.

              <p>
                During the first COVID-19 lockdown, I was asked to jump on the
                phones to help with donation cancellation calls because the
                person who usually handled them was overwhelmed. I was given a
                script that had me ask people to downgrade their gift or pause
                it before finally agreeing to cancel their donation.
              </p>

              <p>
                I felt super uncomfortable asking these questions. Most people
                were calling because they had lost their jobs or weren't getting
                paid during the lockdown and had no extra money to give. It felt
                ethically wrong to ask them to continue donating in any form
                when they were struggling themselves.
              </p>

              <p>
                But I knew I had to ask because people still had cancer, and our
                organisation’s services were needed more than ever. If I didn’t
                at least ask, we might lose a supporter who didn’t realise they
                had options other than cancelling outright.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, looking back, I think that experience was a great learning
                moment for me. It taught me to evaluate situations carefully and
                to push through uncomfortable feelings for the greater good. I
                realised that providing people with all their options helps them
                make informed decisions, which is crucial. This experience
                definitely helped make me a better fundraiser.

                Te Ao Māori shapes the way I see the world. The biggest thing is
                understanding that everything is connected. I tend to look at
                things holistically and see how even the smallest details are
                part of something bigger. My relationship with people and the
                way I treat them is also deeply influenced by manaakitanga,
                which drives me to show respect, generosity, and care.

              <p>
                I am very intentional about the people I have around me. I
                gravitate towards those who think and care deeply and are
                authentically themselves. I appreciate friends who enjoy having
                deep conversations but also respect quiet moments and love being
                silly, whether it's talking about TikToks or juicy gossip. I
                value kindness and am drawn to people who challenge me to see
                the world differently and inspire me to care more deeply about
                new things.

                My strengths are my creativity, curiosity and connecting with
                people. My sense is that I fit being a programmer and the
                mindset of problem-solving - some of my favourite things to do
                at work is coming up with creative solutions. And the stuff
                about the role being more than concepts and more human skills
                suits me great. I'm really riding on the sparkling personality

                In the same vein of problem-solving, I think I tend to sit on
                problems longer than I should before I ask for help. I like how
                that has been mentioned a few times to stick to the timebox and
                ask for help so you can move on. I think having that culture
                from the get go and knowing that there are lots of others in the
                same boat is super helpful.

                Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they
                were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would
                try now and why.
              </p>

              <p>
                I had a situation where I wanted to introduce a planning tool
                like Monday.com to replace our project planner in Excel
                spreadsheets. I needed something more functional, but some of
                the team were resistant to learning a new tool.
              </p>

              <p>
                To address this, I worked through introducing and teaching
                people how to use it. I had team members explore the tool before
                we officially implemented it and gave them the opportunity to
                ask questions. It reminded me of flipped learning, where you
                introduce new concepts for people to explore on their own before
                diving into them fully. However, not everyone took the time to
                trial the tool on their own, which limited the effectiveness of
                this approach.
              </p>

              <p>
                If I were to try again, I would probably introduce the idea of a
                new tool when I first started researching my options. Surprising
                people with something new was a mistake. I think they would have
                been less resistant if they had felt part of the journey from
                the beginning.
              </p>

              <p>
                By involving the team early on and seeking their input during
                the research phase, they would likely feel more invested and
                open to the change. This approach could foster a sense of
                ownership and reduce resistance, making the transition smoother
                and more collaborative.
