      <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>Let's imagine a bike.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>HTML</strong> is the bike itself - the wheels, the handle bars
        and the brakes. It's totally functional.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CSS</strong> is the pizzaz! It's the cute basket on the front,
        the sparkley tassles on the handle bars and the firey red paint (I know
        red makes you go faster, but in this situation it's purely cosmetic).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Javascript</strong> is the electrics, because this is no old
        fashioned bike - it's an e-bike! When you pedal, the motor makes you go
        faster. Just push a button and magic stuff happens without you having to
        put in a whole lot of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Javascript allows you to make your website more interactive and adds
        actions and changes to a page without having to refresh. For example, it
        could be an accordian open up to reveal text at just the click of a
        button.
      </p>
      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        By default, Javascript code is executed top to bottom, line by line -
        similar to CSS. <strong>Control Flow</strong> allows us to control the
        order of execution. <strong>Loops</strong> are one way to control the
        flow of execution by repeating tasks when a criteria is met and are
        written efficiently with less code.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Imagine you have 5 plants to water. You need to repeat the action of
        watering each plant until you've watered all 5. Here's how a loop fits
        into this scenario:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start: </strong>Start at the first plant.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Condition check: </strong>Check if there are more plants to
          water.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>If yes, proceed to water the next plant.</li>
          <li>If no, stop.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Water the plant: </strong>Water the current plant.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Continue to the next plant:</strong> Move on to the next
          plant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repeat: </strong>Go back to the condition check and repeat the
          process.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The loop will continue until there are no plants left to water. And then
        control flow would mean we continue with the next code.
      </p>
      <p>

          code:</strong

      <h2>The DOM</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) allows us to interact with and
        manipulate HTML and CSS using Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOM is an object that represents an HTML document. The browser keeps
        the HTML and DOM in sync - when the DOM updates, the HTML does too, and
        vice versa. And within the DOM, each HTML element is represented as a
        sub-object.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOM has a slightly different interface to what we're used to with
        HTML. The DOM takes the HTML and formats it into a tree structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the DOM, you can select objects (or HTML elements) on a page, use
        methods to listen for events relating to that object, or add properties
        to the element, like change it's background colour or another CSS
        property.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <p>
        The following example selects the elements, defines a function that
        changes the text of the paragraph and thn adds an event listener to the
        button that calls the the changeText function when clicked.
      </p>
      <img
        class="code-snippet"
        src="/images/code-snippets/sprint-3-thedom.png"
        alt="" />
      <h2>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
      <p>
        Arrays and objects are both data structures that you can choose from
        depending on the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Arrays</strong> are a group of indexed items that you can call
        on using their position in the group using "array[index]". You would
        usually use arrays for items where the order matters e.g. lists,
        timelines, series of numbers, group of names, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Objects</strong> can be used to store data that can be
        identified by a name rather than position and you can call them using
        "object.key" or "object[key]".Objects are best for collections of
        key-value pairs such as contact information, product info, words and
        their definitions, etc.
      </p>
      <p>An key difference between the two is the importance of indexing the positions, arrays do this and objects do not.</p>
      <p><strong>What the heck does "key-value pair" mean?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The term "key-value pair" is used to desribe a set of two linked data
          items. e.g. Age: 30;
        </li>
        <li>'Age' would be the key</li>
        <li>'30' would be the value</li>
        <li>
          When you want to know the number of years, you look up 'Age' and find
          it's value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are code that perform specific tasks. A function performs when
        it is called, such as clicking a button, or as part of the default
        control flow. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What's great about them is that they are <strong>reusable</strong> and you can call on them whenever you like and without having to rewrite the same code.
