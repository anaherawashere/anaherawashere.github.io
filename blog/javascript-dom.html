      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to understand and manage our own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It helps us navigate challenges within ourselves and in our relationships. Emotional intelligence is often defined through key pillars: self-awareness, self-management, and empathy.</p>
      <p><strong>Self-awareness</strong> involves recognising and understanding our own feelings and behaviours. For instance, during a group project, you might feel frustrated with someone. Self-awareness allows you to notice this frustration and understand its source. People with high EQ are adept at identifying their emotions and managing their behaviours accordingly.</p>
      <p><strong>Self-management</strong> is the ability to control impulsive feelings and behaviours in healthy ways. For example, receiving difficult news, such as a job rejection or a breakup, won't completely overwhelm someone with high EQ. Instead, they acknowledge their feelings and process them in a healthy manner, allowing them to move forward constructively.</p>
      <p><strong>Empathy</strong> involves being sensitive to the moods and emotions of others, and understanding how these emotions influence behaviour. A person with high EQ might notice a colleague's angry outburst and recognise it as a sign of feeling overwhelmed, perhaps a cry for help. This understanding helps in responding with compassion and support.</p>
      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>IQ measures things like cognitive and intellectual skills like maths and problem-solving. It's tested through standardized exams, and people with high IQs will do well in school and technical fields.</p>
      <p>EQ is about understanding and managing emotions, both your own and others'. It's important for things like communication, handling conflicts, and building strong relationships.</p>
      <p>When it comes to leadership and decision-making, having high EQ is very important. Leaders with strong EQ can better understand their team, handle conflicts smoothly, and make decisions that take everyone's feelings into account. This creates a positive, collaborative work environment and leads to more thoughtful and empathetic decision-making.</p>
      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p>EQ gives people the capability to understand what people are communicating and what they need. It is particularly important for leaders to have a high EQ so they can better understand and manage their teams. It is also important for the world and our future that we are able to empathise with others and that decisions in all aspects of the world are made with people in mind.</p>
