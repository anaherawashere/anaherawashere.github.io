        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>Ideally I'd like to become a full stack developer but I'm also very interested in front-end development. As I start, I want to be able to work alongside others and learn from them in a team setting. I'm also really interested to see if there is any work in the charity sector with my background.</p>
          
          <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
          
          <p>One of my strengths is that I usually pick things up pretty quickly when I listen or read first and then have a hands-on go. </p>
          
          <p>A limitation for me is that I often feel too shy to ask for help. My go-to is to figure it out on my own. I like having the timeboxes, they help me stay on track and give me an idea of whether I'm sitting on a problem for too long.</p>
          
          <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          
          <p>One of my lifetime goals is to be articulate. To be able to say what I mean and be easily understood. While at Dev, I'd like to get better at describing concepts to other people in plain language. I think things make sense in my brain but don't necessarily come out of my mouth in a way that makes sense lol.</p>
          
          <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong></p></li>
              <li><strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong></p></li>
            </ul>
          
          <p>I tend to handle stress pretty well and enjoy working in a team. For me, it's important to have a fun and supportive culture and I like to help make the mood a little lighter with humour. 
          </p>

          <p>I definitely relate to that concept about getting in the zone requiring a small amount of stress - that's my happy place! But when it gets passed a reasonable amount of stress, I will make sure to communicate where I'm at.</p>
          
          <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
          
          <p>I will ask random questions in a forum like discord or in person with peers. And if it gets hard, I will reach out to a tutor in person or online if I need to.</p>

          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

          <p>I expect the facilitation team to provide as much 'real-world' knowledge as they can to help us get career ready. I heard that studying through Uni will teach you everything but bootcamp will teach you what you need to know and that's why I signed up.</p>

          <p>Also the basic, teaching with respect, patience and a bit of compassion. So far all the staff have been really awesome, I feel like I'm in the right place :)</p>

          <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>

          <p>I'm in the middle of setting up my weekly therapy sessions with an interim therapist. It'll be the same hour each week, hoping to schedule it for Wednesdays.</p>
