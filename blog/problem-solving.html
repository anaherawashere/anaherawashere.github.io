              A time I was blocked on a simple problem
            </h3>
            <p>
              I was working on a bunch of small challenges and I got stuck on
              all of them atleast once! There was one in particular that I was
              so sure should work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I checked some of the conversations other people were having about
              the same challenge and I googled each concept in my solution to
              make sure I was structuring it correctly - I couldn't figure out
              why it wasn't working!
            </p>
            <p>
              Then out of frustration I decided to read it aloud to myself,
              literally going line by line and explaining what each bit was
              doing. And then I I said something aloud that sounded funny and I
              found a typo üò≠ I had used the plural of a word that should've
              been singular.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I guess reading aloud and explaining things to yourself again
              is a really great problem solving method.
            </p>
            <h3 class="blog-section | fs-600">Solving a proglem elegantly</h3>
            <p>
              Not sure if this is elegant üíÖ enough but in Javascript you can
              repeat tasks over and over using 'loops' rather than having to
              rewrite the same task each time. There are a few different ways to
              write loops and some might be better in different scenarios. There
              is one type of loop I feel semi-confident in, it's the 'for' loop.
              But it's pretty long to write and other loops can acheive the same
              thing a bit more efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I had a challenge where I needed to use a loop but they way I
              was writing it out felt really long and I had to add layers of
              other functions to be able to get the solution I wanted. I got
              about half way and then though nah, I have to try them other loops
              people keep mentioning. So I did a youtube search of people
              explaining one of these fancier loops and I was able to write my
              solution in like 3 lines!
            </p>
            <p>
              I think I could have done what I needed to with the skills I
              already had (the longer version) but it just wouldn't have been
              that efficient and I wouldn't learn much new from doing the same
              thing over and over. I was super pleased I got the solution I
              wanted and was able to learn something new!

            <h3 class="blog-section | fs-600">A time I was reluctant to ask for help and what I'd do differently next time</h3>
            <p>On my last Kata challenge I couldn't figure out how to select words that matched an annoying word despite capitalisation and it almost took me out! It was the final challenge and I was SOOO close!!</p>
            <p>In this situtaion I was reluctant to ask for help mostly because of my pride. I wanted to finish off on a high having done most of the other challenges without asking for help.</p>
            <p>In the end I got there but it definitely took me longer than it would've if I had just asked. Actually every challenge took me longer because I didn't just ask!</p>
            <p>If time is going to be essential for any tasks, I am going to prioritise asking people for help.</p>
